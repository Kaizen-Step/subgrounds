st.write(""" ### How Curve Finance Governance Works  ? ##  """)

st.write("""
The governance of Curve Finance is managed through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure, which allows token holders to participate in decision-making processes related to the protocol's development, upgrades, and parameters. **CRV Token**: Curve's native governance token is called CRV. CRV token holders have the right to participate in governance decisions by voting on proposals. The number of votes a holder has is proportional to the number of CRV tokens they own.    
**Governance Proposals**: Anyone in the community can create a governance proposal. These proposals can cover a wide range of topics, such as protocol upgrades, changes to trading fees, parameter adjustments, partnerships, and more. Once a proposal is created, it goes through a voting process. CRV token holders can vote either in favor, against, or abstain from a proposal. The voting period typically lasts for a specific number of days. For a proposal to be considered valid, it often needs to meet certain quorum and approval thresholds. Quorum refers to the minimum percentage of total CRV tokens that need to be participating in the vote. Approval thresholds determine the minimum percentage of votes needed to pass a proposal.If a proposal reaches the required quorum and approval thresholds, and the voting period concludes, the proposal can be executed based on the outcome. The specific execution process might vary depending on the protocol's technical implementation.
